# Transaction Relayer Service   

The transaction relayer is a service that dapp developers can plug into their apps to pay for their users gas costs.   
This a subscription based service: the app developer subscribes on-chain using our frontend. Then they get a monthly quota that they can use for certain smart contract addresses to subsidize their user's transactions.
